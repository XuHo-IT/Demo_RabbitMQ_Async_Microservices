This project demonstrates an asynchronous microservices architecture using RabbitMQ and MassTransit in .NET. 
The system includes services that communicate through message queues and respond to events by triggering webhooks.

ðŸ’¡ Project Description
The system is made up of multiple microservices that communicate asynchronously using RabbitMQ as a message broker.
This design allows services to operate independently while exchanging messages through MassTransit, a .NET messaging library.

A typical use case in this project involves a service publishing an event (e.g., user registration or order placed)
, and another service consuming that event to perform a task, such as sending a notification or triggering an external webhook.

ðŸ§  Webhook Integration
A webhook is used to send real-time HTTP requests from the consumer service to another system when a specific event occurs.
This enables immediate communication between internal or external systems without polling or manual triggers.
